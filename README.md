### DATA HIGHLIGHTS

The highlights from this analysis include an impressive ridership number and dedicated subscriber base. Over `2.3 million` rides were recorded in August 2019, which is typically the most profitable month. Over `81%` of all users are subscribers, which indicates that CitiBike services are utilized often enough to warrant a subscription, and are in-demand.

Also included in the highlights is the peak hour data for the month. Ridership remains fairly steady from 7 AM to 9 PM, with peaks during the morning and evening rush hours (8AM-10AM and 4PM-8PM, respectively). Regarding the off-peak hours between 2AM and 5AM, this provides a window to conduct bike repairs and other maintenance activities.


### TRIPS BY WEEKDAY PER HOUR

The heatmap for Trips by Weekday Per Hour further demonstrates that the on-peak times established with the previous map correspond with commuter rush hours, as most activity is observed on weekdays during these times, particularly on Thursday's. There is consistent usage of this service on weekends as well, with the peak times between 10 AM and 12 PM. Interestingly, the usage during Wednesday's evening rush-hour is lower than the other weekdays, and it may be worthwhile to explore to increase ridership on this day.

### USER CHECKOUT TIMES

The User Checkout Times graphic displays number of trips by duration, and indicates that the vast majority of rides are under 20 minutes in length. The number of rides drops dramatically under the 30-minute mark, which is likely due to the [surcharge](https://help.citibikenyc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032024912-How-long-can-I-keep-a-bike-out-) applied after 30 minutes of usage.

A cross-analysis of the Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) by User Type. The users are probably tourists, and not subscribers.
