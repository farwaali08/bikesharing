The highlights from this analysis include an impressive ridership number and dedicated subscriber base. Over `2.3 million` rides were recorded in August 2019, which is typically the most profitable month. Over `81%` of all users are subscribers, which indicates that CitiBike services are utilized often enough to warrant a subscription, and are in-demand. All are important when considering bike-sharing programs for other cities, 

Also included in the highlights is the peak hour data for the month. Ridership remains fairly steady from 7 AM to 8 PM, with peaks during the morning and evening rush hours (8AM-9M and 4PM-7PM, respectively).
