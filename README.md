### DATA HIGHLIGHTS

The highlights from this analysis include an impressive ridership number and dedicated subscriber base. Over `2.3 million` rides were recorded in August 2019, which is typically the most profitable month. Over `81%` of all users are subscribers, which indicates that CitiBike services are utilized often enough to warrant a subscription, and are in-demand.

Also included in the highlights is the peak hour data for the month. Ridership remains fairly steady from 7 AM to 9 PM, with peaks during the morning and evening rush hours (8AM-10AM and 4PM-8PM, respectively). Regarding the off-peak hours between 2AM and 5AM, this provides a window to conduct bike repairs and other maintenance activities.
